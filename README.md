# Pixify - Python and OpenCV Game for Beginners

Pixify is an engaging game designed for beginners to learn Python and OpenCV through hands-on coding challenges. Players are tasked with writing code to extract embedded letters from personalized test cases generated using image processing techniques. At the end all the letters in the testcases translate to a unique word which is the most fun part of this game :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::grin:

## Introduction

Pixify is a game that introduces users (especially beginners) to Python and OpenCV by challenging them to decode personalized test cases. The game consists of three main components: `verify_code.exe`, `test_case_generator.exe`, and `pixify_decode.py`. Each player interacts with the `pixify_decode.py` file, crafting solutions to extract embedded letters from the unique test cases generated by `test_case_generator.exe`. The `verify_code.exe` tool automatically checks and validates the player's code.

## Image Description

Each test image has 3 essential components :-
1) Red squares at intersections.
2) Yellow squares at intersections.
3) Shapes inside the grid containing shapes.

- Every Image depicts a letter which the user is supposed to decode.
- The letter is given by converting an integer which is extracted from the image.
- The formula for the integer is - ( 1x*no.of red squares at intersections* ) + ( 2x*no.of yellow squares at intersections* ) + ( 1x*no.of squares containing shapes* )
- For eg , integer from the above image is 1x8 + 2x1 + 1x10 = 20 . Hence the letter corresponds to **T**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (**use cmd, try avoiding powershell**):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sree-harsh/Pixify-OpenCV-Game.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd Pixify-OpenCV-Game
    ```
## Game Components

### 1. verify_code.exe

The `verify_code.exe` executable is a tool to automatically check and validate the player's code. After completing the challenge in `pixify_decode.py`, use this tool to verify the correctness of your solution.

```bash
verify_code.exe 
```
The executable can also be run by double clicking the .exe file ( Not Recommended )
### 2. test_case_generator.exe

The test_case_generator.exe executable generates personalized test cases for each player. These test cases contain embedded letters that players need to extract using image processing techniques in their pixify_decode.py solution.

```bash
test_case_generator.exe 
```
The executable can also be run by double clicking the .exe file ( Not Recommended )

### 3. pixify_decode.py

The pixify_decode.py file is where players write their code to solve the challenge. Open this file and follow the instructions to implement the image processing techniques required to extract the embedded letters from the personalized test cases.

```bash
python3 pixify_decode.py
```

## How to Play
1. Run the testcase_generator executable and it will ask you for your name for to generate personalized test cases . The executable will
   -  Create a folder named test_cases in the same working directory if not present.
   - If a folder named test_cases is already present, and if it has some test cases already present then the executable will delete all the old ones and add new ones.
2. Write your code to solve the challenge in pixify_decode.py . Note - you are allowed to only edit the **decode** function and are not allowed to import any modules other than those already present.
3. Once done coding the correct solution, run the verify_code.exe executable  to check your solution. The executable would prompt you if your solution is wrong.

## BONUS
Once you are able to generate the correct solution to the test cases generated by you, the executable might give some interesting feedback based on your code and the word that you've decoded . So, watch out for that!

## Dont's
Here are some Dont's which should be kept in mind at all times :-
1) Do no delete or alter the sample_image_without_grid.py
2) Do not import libraries other than those already mentioned in the pixify_decode.py
3) Do not change the name of the pixify_decode.py python file
4) Edit only the decode function inside the python file as per the instructions mentioned
5) The executables are designed to work only on **Windows** for now
6) **Use the cmd command prompt to run the files and not Windows Powershell**
7) Make sure you run the test_case_generator executable just after cloning the repository
